# 100PROJECTSCHALLENGE
I Challenged myself to work on 100 EmbeddedML projects based on Arduino NAno 33 BLE Sense and Edge Impulse in 2023



This repository contains a collection of 100 embedded ML projects developed using Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and Edge Impulse.

## Overview

These projects range from simple to complex and cover various aspects of embedded machine learning. They leverage the capabilities of the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board and the Edge Impulse platform for data collection, model training, and deployment on edge devices.

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects, you will need:
- Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board
- Access to the Edge Impulse platform
- Arduino Web Editor as the compiler and development environment

## Project Structure

Each project is organized in its own directory, containing the necessary code, configuration files, and any additional resources. The projects are designed to be self-contained and can be easily opened and compiled in the Arduino Web Editor.
